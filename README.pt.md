# **Protocolo de risco Tokenizado** 
#### ***Um protocolo de derivativos de flutuações para proteger a sensibilidade do rendimento e o preço de mercado***

## Resumo

BarnBridge é uma ideia e um whitepaper originalmente concebido no segundo trimestre de 2019. Na época, a MakerDAO estava começando a atrair a atenção do público e a capturar a imaginação do que agora é conhecido como DeFi, ou comunidade de finanças descentralizadas. Mais de um ano depois, com 60% da dívida global rendendo menos de 1% e mais de US $15 trilhões de dívida global rendendo taxas negativas, o capital continua se movendo para fluxos de rendimento de risco mais alto. Isso não é uma coincidência ou uma tendência. Falando historicamente, desde os tempos bíblicos, o capital de giro persegue o rendimento, assumindo um risco relativamente igual. 

A aceleração dos níveis de dívida, em todo o mundo, estava acontecendo antes da crise financeira causada pela Covid-19. No primeiro trimestre de 2020, vimos a dívida global aumentar para US $258 trilhões. Esse número está 331% acima do PIB global, de acordo com o IIF, que representa bancos e instituições financeiras globais. Com o Federal Reserve operando sob o pretexto de ter um suprimento infinito de dinheiro e o eufemismo "impressora de dinheiro go brrrr" se juntando ao léxico dominante, é bastante claro que esses números provavelmente aumentarão e a emissão de dívida para o PIB continuará a acelerar. 

O sistema financeiro tradicional, referido como TradFi neste artigo, está passando por um aumento histórico nos níveis de dívida agregada, enquanto o rendimento e as taxas de juros despencam. Enquanto isso, há um sistema financeiro descentralizado, referido como DeFi neste artigo, florescendo na economia digital com ativos digitais e criptomoedas. Embora os níveis de dívida, que são chamados de TVL, ou valor total bloqueado em protocolos financeiros descentralizados, tenham aumentado de centenas de milhões no ano passado para bilhões de dólares em 2020, o rendimento desses instrumentos continua a diminuir as taxas servis oferecidas por produtos comparáveis no sistema TradFi legado. Por outro lado, devido aos níveis de risco mais altos assumidos, juntamente com eficiências mais altas fornecidas por tecnologias de contrato inteligente, o rendimento percentual anual (APY) é muito mais alto em protocolos descentralizados do que o que pode ser encontrado no sistema financeiro tradicional. O capital de giro segue a tendência histórica de maior rendimento, razão pela qual vemos a TVL passando para o DeFi em um ritmo acelerado. Essa é uma tendência que vai continuar.

A necessidade de existirem instrumentos TradFi familiares em todo o ecossistema DeFi nunca foi tão forte.  **BarnBridge é uma ideia cuja hora chegou** 

## DeFi Primer: Rampas de Risco e TradFi Bridges

Os produtos de rendimento nos mercados descentralizados que estão rendendo APY mais alto do que os produtos de rendimento em mercados tradicionais são atualmente empréstimos garantidos por criptografia. Em vez de vender criptografia por decreto, os mutuários estão apostando em ativos digitais e recebendo ativos digitais em troca. Embora esses empréstimos tenham sido principalmente empréstimos de curto prazo para comerciantes, o sistema provou ser eficiente e maduro para expansão. Essas eficiências inevitavelmente atrairão empréstimos de maior valor e duração mais longa para livros-razão descentralizados. As eficiências referenciadas são possibilitadas pela capacidade dos contratos inteligentes de reter garantias digitais até que ambos os lados da transação cumpram suas obrigações por meio de algoritmos. A redução da custódia, liquidação e caução - ações que exigem muita mão de obra e custosas dentro do sistema legado - a ações algorítmicas está reduzindo o aluguel cobrado pela mão de obra para realizar essas ações. Essas eficiências, juntamente com a percepção de maior risco, são a razão pela qual os rendimentos são maiores em sistemas descentralizados. Como o risco no DeFi converge para os níveis de risco percebidos na TradFi, pela natureza dos empréstimos que mudam de empréstimos garantidos por criptografia para comerciantes para empréstimos hipotecários garantidos para proprietários de casas, por exemplo, a eficiência dos contratos inteligentes continuará a oferecer maior rendimento em sistemas descentralizados do que sistemas centralizados tradicionais.


Além do mais, a eficiência de contratos inteligentes e tecnologias DAO permite que instrumentos derivativos muito mais complexos sejam construídos e fornece um nível de transparência e segurança incompreensível para as redes financeiras atuais.

Todas essas eficiências são atualmente controladas e construídas a partir de empréstimos garantidos por criptografia.

![](images/1newnew.png)

Conforme discutido anteriormente, essas eficiências devem extrapolar para dívidas hipotecárias e dívidas corporativas mudando para plataformas descentralizadas em um cronograma mais longo. Isso também deve encorajar derivativos mais complexos baseados em dívida e rendimento a migrar para plataformas descentralizadas. Seremos capazes de estruturar derivados muito mais complexos e rastreá-los com muito mais eficiência e transparência do que possível antes que as inovações de blockchain, criptomoeda, contratos inteligentes e tecnologia de organização autônoma descentralizada fossem realizadas. US $ 244 trilhões em derivativos baseados em dívida e rendimento continuarão a migrar para tecnologias mais eficientes ao longo do tempo. A migração de rendimentos e derivados baseados em rendimentos de sistemas financeiros centralizados menos eficientes para sistemas financeiros descentralizados mais eficientes será um dos maiores movimentos de riqueza da história humana.   **BarnBridge existe para ajudar a facilitar essa transição e tornar o sistema financeiro descentralizado mais eficiente, flexível ao risco e atraente para uma gama mais ampla de participantes.**

Há um enorme mercado para pessoas que desejam entrar na criptografia que (1) não querem arrancar toda a curva de risco de possuir, emprestar ou receber um ativo digital inteiro & (2) nunca perderá tempo para usar um Organização autônoma descentralizada (DAO) para criar um contrato inteligente que roteiriza algoritmicamente os dois lados do empréstimo ou contrato. Mais de 99,9% da dívida global ainda está estruturada em mercados tradicionais e carente de rendimento. Por outro lado, as empresas financeiras mais avançadas não têm tolerância a riscos. Isso permite estruturas diferentes em cada ponto da curva de rendimento, com os mais arriscados (provavelmente os fundos de hedge) querendo colocar menos dinheiro com o maior retorno para sua aposta/hedge. Pelo contrário, os investidores mais conservadores muitas vezes estão dispostos a abrir mão de uma grande parte das oportunidades de alta para acessar instrumentos mais seguros. Produtos “sem risco”, como a tradFi os descreve, não são oferecidos atualmente no ecossistema financeiro descentralizado. A oportunidade de estruturar esses tipos de instrumentos permitirá que mais investidores avessos ao risco nos mercados tradicionais migrem para os mercados descentralizados.

![](images/image6.png)

Na fase de curto prazo (DeFi) e na fase de médio prazo (Prova de Participação), as rampas de risco continuarão a criar mercados e indústrias para empresas de investimento tradicionais que desejam "sair do zero" ou "chegar acima de 1%". À medida que isso acontece, mais e mais tipos de empréstimos serão transferidos para livros-razão descentralizados. No longo prazo, e parcialmente por meio desse processo, credores e devedores entenderão por que intermediários descentralizados e sem confiança são superiores e menos onerosos do que os intermediários terceirizados atuais. À medida que isso acontecer, porções maiores dos US $ 244 trilhões em dívida global passarão para a cadeia, criando a oportunidade para mais rendimento, mais rampas de risco e produtos mais altos do tipo CD (dívida colateralizada) para depositantes fiduciários e criptográficos do comercial da nova era bancos e mercados financeiros.
 

## 1. Protocolo de derivativos de flutuação

BarnBridge é o primeiro protocolo de derivativos de flutuação. Antes do advento da tecnologia de contrato inteligente, era quase impossível rastrear e atribuir o rendimento a uma distribuição dividida de capital, de forma confiável e transparente, para fornecer proteção contra todas e quaisquer flutuações. Conceitualmente, você pode construir produtos derivados de qualquer tipo de flutuação impulsionada pelo mercado para proteger vários riscos. Os exemplos incluem, mas não estão limitados a, sensibilidade à taxa de juros, flutuações no preço de mercado subjacente, flutuações nas probabilidades de mercado preditivas, flutuações nas taxas de inadimplência em hipotecas, flutuações nos preços de commodities e um número aparentemente infinito de flutuações baseadas no mercado para proteger um determinado posição. 

We plan to create the first cross platform derivatives protocol for any and all fluctuations.  To start, we will focus on yield sensitivity & market price.  Downstream, we plan to introduce a far wider variety of hedges against fluctuations in the decentralized ecosystem.  BarnBridge aims to be platform and asset agnostic. 

You can reduce the risk of digital assets & digital asset yield sensitivity by breaking them into essentially infinite, separate, dollar-denominated chunks, or tranches, and building derivatives off these tranches.  BarnBridge aims to smooth out the risk curve and offer layered risk management to both DeFi & tradFi investors by building more efficient debt & yield based derivatives. 

## 2. Initial Product Offerings

SMART $BONDS - **S**tructured **M**arket **A**djusted **R**isk **T**ranches

### 2.1 SMART Yield Bonds 

Interest rate volatility risk mitigation using debt based derivatives.

Currently, the decentralized financial system is primarily offering variable rate annuities.  However, the ability to structure yield into fixed rates will come in the form of locked collateral with a maturity on repayments, or bonds, as well as fixed rate yields with no maturity, or annuities. We don’t believe this to be a novel idea & we believe naturally that these types of products will come to DeFi over time. However, the types of derivatives & complexity reduction in financial planning you’ll be able to structure and implement with the existence of fixed yield in smart contracts will be mind blowing to traditional financial markets.

Decentralized financial instruments are showcasing the power that a trustless financial industry can wield.  Powerhouse projects in the DeFi space like MakerDAO, Synthetix, AAVE, Compound, Curve, and others are producing yields for users that have none of the constraints and rent seeking of tradFi instruments by replacing bookkeepers, escrow and various overhead with algorithms, trustless oracles, and decentralized ledgers. Different market driven yields can be found on numerous decentralized platforms, but there is nothing out there that services & pulls together all of the different decentralized protocols & allows for a normalized risk curve and derivatives for risk mitigation.

Furthermore, efficiencies across lending protocols are non-existent in the current DeFi markets. The ability to pull yield from numerous protocols and tranche them into higher and lower yield buckets is something that exists in traditional financial markets but is more efficient in decentralized financial markets, assuming an acceptable level of liquidity. 

Our first structuring will not only allow DeFi users to get access to fixed yield but also pools yield from numerous protocols across the ecosystem creating a more efficient market, again, smoothing out the yield curve across the entire industry. 

While we expect singular lending protocols to introduce concepts around fixed income on their platform, a major differentiation of a cross protocol based approach to fixed income is the diversified assets & diversified platform risk. By algorithmically pooling interest generating digital assets on a number of lending platforms, we will create greater efficiencies by spreading risk & normalizing the industry risk curve. Since BarnBridge does not lend money directly off a native platform, & instead pools lending across the industry, it allows us to be platform agnostic & digital asset agnostic which in turn will allow for more complex structuring and bond rating systems downstream.

**Risk and Loss Scenarios.**

![](images/1abb1.png)

**Scenario 1:**

![](images/Group899.png)

**Scenario 2:**

![](images/Group1031.png)

Pooled collateral would be deposited into lending protocols or yield generating contracts, and the yield will be bundled up into different tranches and tokenized. So you could buy exposure to the most senior tranche and get a lower yield but have a much lower risk profile. SMART bonds are a way to buy and sell risk on yield with all of the pricing driven purely by the market.

[Reference financial structuring can be found here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/157p5D_E_j_zYwc_QzHmVeJH_L64HubkXDPdMwVUkypY/edit#gid=2024388043)

### 2.2 SMART Alpha Bonds 

Market Price Exposure Risk Mitigation using tranched volatility derivatives.

The SMART Alpha bonds will not be structured via traditional yield tranches but instead with various levels of market price exposure, which we will call risk ramps.  The idea is that every bucket or tranche of price exposure does not need to be flat across the entire risk curve, meaning the first $100 of price exposure does not need to deserve the same upside and downside volatility.   **This is similar to having fractional ownership but with different risk/reward for the fractions.**

For example, if the current price of 1 ETH is expected to be $1000, and moves to $900, the first tranche (the riskiest tranches) takes a higher percentage of the loss.  Conversely, if the current price of 1 ETH is expected to be $1000, and moves to $1100, the first tranche (the riskiest tranches) takes a higher percentage of the gain.  

How these gains and losses are measured & allocated across tranches can be done algorithmically with smart contracts.  Each tranche can be traded as a unique digital asset.  For example jETH (a junior tranche of ETH price exposure), mETH (a mezzanine tranche of ETH price exposure, and sETH (a senior tranche of ETH price exposure). The tranches will exist as risk ramps in which users of various risk appetites can gain price exposure to digital assets.

The SMART Alpha product will make way to build tranches of single asset and multi-asset pools that generate yield and where lower risk ramps get lower returns when the underlying assets rise & lower losses when they drop. However, we can build this without needing yield attached at all. The opportunity for downstream opportunities to use various risk ramps for differing collateral obligations is a logical progression these risk ramps will create.

## 3. Token - $BOND

BOND is an ERC-20 token. It will be used to stake in the system, and as a governance token when the governance module is launched. As it conforms to the ERC-20 standard, the $BOND token is tradeable on any exchange and storable on any wallet - allowing anyone in the world to access it.

### 3.1 Distribution

The distribution breakdown is designed to facilitate the most decentralized protocol and make sure power doesn’t reside in the hands of a few.

![](images/TokenDistribution.png)

#### 3.1.1 Fair Vesting

The vesting schedule is designed so that there is not a giant cliff waiting over users heads at a specific point.  The tokens allocated to the Founders, Seed Investors, and Advisors are locked in a smart contract that releases the tokens on a weekly basis over a two year period.  The vesting period starts with the launch of the Yield Farming mechanism.  This breaks down as such:
- Total amount of $BOND tokens: 10,000,000
- Percent of $BOND tokens allocated to Founders, Seed Investors, & Advisors: 22%
- Total amount of $BOND tokens vested: 2,200,000
- Length of vesting: 100 weeks
- Release schedule: 1 week
- Amount of $BOND tokens released each week: 22,000
- Percent of $BOND tokens released each week: 0.22%

### 3.2 Governance

The $BOND token will be the system’s governance token, empowering $BOND holders to vote on updates to the platform. Combining governance mechanisms and incentivizing holders, it will serve as a means to align the different stakeholders in the system.  $BOND will also serve as a security and policy management medium. Decentralized, automated governance, that incentivizes participants and aims for security, sustainability, and participant welfare is key to a DeFi protocol’s success. 

#### 3.2.1 DAO First Approach

BarnBridge is taking a “DAO First Approach” to spinning up the protocol, choosing to use decentralized tools from the start to achieve our final goal of complete decentralization and having a flexible smart contract system able to add / upgrade / remove functionality all based on DAO proposals. There will be an incubator DAO called Launch DAO & the final protocol DAO called BarnBridge DAO.

![](images/DAOFirst12.png)

#### **Launch DAO**

Starting with Launch DAO, the Founders, Seeders, and Advisors are using an Aragon DAO Company Template which uses transferable tokens to represent ownership stake.  Decisions are made based on stake-weighted voting. The native token of the Launch DAO will be $BBVOTE. The Founders will receive 45%, Seeders will receive 45%, and Advisors will get 10%.  The support will be set to 62%, which means more than 62% of the voting shares need to be present at a vote.  The minimum will be set to 62%, meaning for a proposal to be passed it must be approved by at least 62%.  

The funds from the seeders and the initial supply of the $BOND token will be kept in the Launch DAO treasury.  Launch DAO will also have Aragon Agent activated and we will possibly develop integrations for Uniswap pool allocation and Balancer pool allocation control directly into the DAO. 

![](images/21.png)

#### **BarnBridge DAO**

BarnBridge DAO will be the DAO that is controlled by the $BOND community.  The BarnBridge DAO will have full control over the protocol and the features that are built into it.  We are doing this through the use of the the [Diamond Standard (EIP-2535)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535), which allows us to upgrade the protocol without having all the members remove their tokens and switch to a version 2 of the protocol that time arises.  The BarnBridge DAO will have full control over the Diamond which provides amazing flexibility in the WEB3 space.  We expand on this in the Smart Contracts section (4.2.1).  

## 4. Scope of Work

### 4.1 Development Introduction

The following section describes the MVP / Beta release of the product, which will help inform the product development direction, allow us to start collecting data and ensure the product is aligned with what the market needs.

We are determined to provide a great user experience for users, making sure previous pools are visible and our community can make a well informed decision about when and how to join in. However, we expect the community to build some of the analytics which will accompany the core product.  We welcome this development as it will provide more insight into the product.

### 4.2 Components & Timelines

#### **Launch DAO**

We will use the community contracts based on Aragon DAO Company Template to create the base of the core DAO. Because the contracts have already been in production for so long, we trust the functionality and features they provide. 

We expect to do minimum changes to the initial source code. However, we will create tests for our most common use cases, make sure the user flow makes sense and the users have an easy UX to join in the DAO.
- Estimated time to build, test and launch: **Completed**

#### **BarnBridge DAO**

This subsequent DAO might need to have multiple specific functionality that the Aragon DAO Company Template does not already have. This is why we will likely choose an upgradable smart contract system (such as [EIP-2535](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535)), which will allow us to add, remove and upgrade functionality as the community sees fit.

The BarnBridge DAO will become the core component of the BarnBridge Platform because it will be able to make decisions in a decentralized manner that will be able to enforce the best actions for the wellness of the community.
- Estimated time to build, test and launch on testnet: **6 weeks**

An additional external audit will push the launch on the mainnet by approximately **4 weeks.**  More details in 4.2.2 on Audits & Simulations. 

#### **SMART Yield Bonds**

The whole DAO setup is done to solidify the path towards SMART Yield Bonds.  This is the first DeFi product of the BarnBridge Platform. The Voting DAO will be able to deploy pools that anyone can join if they want to take advantage of this core mechanic.  

Because the DAO’s control the whole system, which means the community decides how the system will be used, the parameters for this DeFi product will be in part determined by the community.  Some of the other parameters will be decided by the decentralized oracle system (such as Chainlink), which needs to set proper, real and attainable parameters for the pools to be valid.

This consists of pool contracts that the users interact with, the deployment factories that deploy & set up the pool contracts, and the complimentary back-end and front-end that creates a high fidelity UX for the community.
- Estimated time to build, test and launch on the testnet (including the oracle system): **12 weeks**

An additional external audit will push the launch on the mainnet by approximately **6 weeks.** More details in 4.2.2 on Audits & Simulations. 

#### **SMART Alpha Bonds**

Following the model of the SMART Yield Bonds, the DAO controls the setup and the parameters for SMART Alpha Bonds. Additionally the smart contract oracles will be critical in determining the price of the staked assets, as well as the price when the pool period starts and also when the period ends, to have a fair distribution of earnings or losses.  

This DeFi product is composed of the actual pool contracts the users interact with, specific deployment factories, which deploy and set up the pool contracts, and the complimentary back-end and front-end.
- Estimated time to build, test and launch: **20 weeks**

An additional external audit will push the launch on the mainnet by approximately **6 weeks.** More details in 4.2.2 on Audits & Simulations. 

#### 4.2.1 Smart Contracts

Because we want to have a completely decentralized system, our whole infrastructure is based around a community driven DAO. The DAO will be the owner of the core contracts of the system and will be able to define what the contracts are able to do.

The architecture is using the [Diamond Standard (EIP-2535)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) which allows for smart contracts to add, upgrade or remove functionality. The Ethereum smart contracts are limited to 24KB of maximum contract size, however implementing this standard allows us to bypass this limitation.

It also allows the BarnBridge DAO to choose what functionality to be changed and how. If we promise that a specific functionality will be later disabled from the contract system, we can remove the bytecode which was specifically describing that functionality. That means that there’s no risk of that part of the contract to be re-enabled in the future. Because we can remove specific parts of the contract, we remove the bloat from our contract system, making them easily auditable by the community, while having greater flexibility. 

This will not only be an amazing addition to the tech stack but also would help push forward the Ethereum ecospace. This EIP brings many advantages, not only to our protocol, but the Ethereum ecosystem at the aggregate level.

To keep the core philosophy of having a completely decentralized system, we will use a decentralized oracle system such as Chainlink. This will allow us to do off-chain computation that can be later used on-chain. This will be useful for, but not limited to, setting pool parameters such as the lending APY. Of course this off-chain system can be replaced and upgraded by the DAO.

![](images/image12.png)

#### 4.2.2 Audit & Simulations

To make sure our platform behaves as we expect it to, we will do multiple internal audits throughout the development cycle.  Our team has the capability to write secure code that behaves according to the specs. 

Additionally, to the internal audits, we will do external audits with top companies in this space.  External reviews are an absolute requirement as the development team is too close to the written code to look at it with fresh, new eyes & be critical of the design choices.  An external audit reveals inconsistencies between specifications and implementation, makes sure the documentation is updated, stresses the security model of the smart contract, and creates a better experience for the actors interacting with the contracts.

On top of audits, we will also do agent simulations to model different scenarios and user behaviors, in order to visualize how the system evolves over time.  We can model different user strategies that interact with our system and fast forward time to see how the system’s properties change.

We will also do formal verification of core contract functionality.  Formal verification is an expensive and complex process but it provides additional security.  Core parts of the system will be modeled and formally verified by our team internally but also by external auditors.  It is important to make sure that we do this because the distribution, internal accounting, mathematical properties and specific variants keep our users safe.

#### 4.3 Post-MVP 

The post MVP, or the next release of the product will have the mainnet release as its highlight.  Protocol agnostic SMART Yield Bonds, and development and testing of the SMART Alpha product will mark the post MVP - and therefore complete the launch of the full featured BarnBridge protocol and products.  The SMART Yield product and liquidity mining will launch before the SMART Alpha product. 

## 5 Future Work

#### 5.1.1 Gas Fees

As multiple operations with different gas costs are necessary, these fees can add up pretty quickly. There are layer 2 solutions that would increase scalability and allow for complex operations and large numbers of transfers while simultaneously reducing associated costs. A potential solution that has already hit mainnet (looking at you Loopring) are zk rollups - which at a high level involve the bundling up transfers into a single transaction. Most of the computations are done off chain, and enforced through validity proofs. Moving the heavy lifting off-chain allows for much higher throughput, keeps costs lower, and - just as importantly - doesn’t sacrifice security. For an app that targets large numbers of active users, a solution aimed at scalability is the way to go. 

#### 5.1.2 SMART Swaps - one loan broken into 4 instruments

#### 5.1.3 SMART Prediction Hedge - Derivatives hedging fluctuations in prediction market odds.

#### 5.1.4 Market Driven Ratings Oracle - Trestle Point Index

Leveraging the wisdom of the crowd we can create an index that works as a ratings system providing an oracle mechanism that can be used by any platform in DeFi. A Moody’s for the decentralized future if you will. 

The risk assessment framework used to rate the tranches could be used to determine market sentiment. Driven by the markets that form behind the tokenized tranches, the ratings that determine the tranche formation would become a ‘fear gauge’. In short, if the riskier tranches are more popular then it could offer an early sign that the underlying components are less risky. Similarly, if the usage of the lower yield, safer tranches see an increase in volume, this could be an early warning sign that a vulnerability was found and an attack is potentially imminent.
